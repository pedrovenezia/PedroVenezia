### Hi there, I'm a Sound Engineering Student & Researcher 👋

I am currently an undergraduate student at **Universidad Nacional de Tres de Febrero (UNTREF)**, working on my thesis regarding **active control of low-frequency sound absorption** using electroacoustic transducers.

My work bridges the gap between **music** and **engineering**, combining a passion for live sound production with rigorous academic research.

#### 🔭 Current Research & Academic Focus
* **Thesis:** Technical development of electroacoustic devices for active low-frequency absorption.
* **Interests:** Room acoustics, source-room interaction, electroacoustics, electromechanics, and transducer electronics.
* **Teaching:** * Current **Teaching Assistant** for *Acoustics & Psychoacoustics 1* (UNTREF).
    * Former TA for *Physics 1 (Classical Mechanics)* and *Electricity & Magnetism*.

#### 🎛️ Professional Experience: Live Sound & Systems
I work as a technician for large-scale theaters and venues, handling:
* **System Design:** Prediction, planning, and implementation of sound reinforcement systems.
* **System Tuning:** On-site calibration and acoustic measurements.
* **Operations:** FOH/Monitor mixing, streaming mixes, and stage management.
* **Connectivity:** Deployment of digital interconnect systems (MADI, Dante).

#### 🚀 Future Goals
I am focused on developing my skills in **Architectural Acoustics**, specifically aiming toward the design and construction of professional recording, mixing, and mastering studios.
